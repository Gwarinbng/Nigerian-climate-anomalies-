# Nigerian-climate-anomalies-
Analysis of Nigerian climate anomalies (1970–2023) using data from 38 weather stations. Includes scripts and notebooks to compute temperature and precipitation anomalies, and visualize trends across regions for research, teaching, and policy.

📌 Project Overview

The Nigerian Climate Anomalies repository provides a reproducible framework for analyzing climate anomalies across Nigeria using long-term observational records. At the heart of this project is a unique dataset from 38 meteorological stations distributed across Nigeria, covering the period 1970 to 2023. These stations provide daily and monthly observations of temperature and precipitation, which form the backbone for examining historical climate variability and recent shifts.

The project focuses on computing climate anomalies, defined as deviations from long-term averages or climatology. By comparing observed values against a chosen baseline period, anomalies reveal unusual conditions such as extreme heatwaves, prolonged dry spells, or exceptionally heavy rainfall. This perspective is vital for identifying signals of climate change, understanding regional climate variability, and evaluating impacts on agriculture, water resources, health, and infrastructure.

Visualization plays a central role in this project. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks and scripts to generate time series plots, and statistical summaries. By presenting the results spatially and temporally, the analysis highlights regional differences across Nigeria.

The repository is designed as a resource for researchers, students, and policymakers. It can be used for academic studies, hydrological assessments, teaching in climate and environmental science courses, and policy-relevant investigations into climate resilience. Its open-source structure encourages collaboration and ensures that methods and findings can be adapted, extended, or replicated for other regions and datasets.

By documenting and analyzing anomalies from 1970–2023, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of Nigeria’s climate variability and change, supporting evidence-based strategies for resilience, adaptation, and sustainable development.
